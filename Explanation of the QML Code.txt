Explanation of the QML Code
ApplicationWindow: This is the main window for the QML application.
Properties:
maxVolume: The maximum volume level.
currentVolume: The current volume level, initialized to 50.
isMuted: A boolean indicating if the TV is muted.
Volume Control:
A Column layout holds the volume control buttons and the volume display.
The top Button increases the volume.
The Rectangle in the middle represents the volume bar with a blue rectangle indicating the current volume level. The Text inside shows the current volume or "Muted" when muted.
The bottom Button decreases the volume.
A Mute button toggles the mute state.
Connections:
The Connections element listens for signals from the remote control (simulated here as a remoteControl object), adjusting the volume or toggling mute accordingly.
